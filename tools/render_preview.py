"""
Draws one preview image per animation preset.

Rofi cannot show an animated preview: its binary only links
gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_scale, the single-frame loader, and has no
gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file at all. A GIF handed to it renders as its
first frame — for a fade-out animation, usually an empty rectangle.

So the preview is a strobe instead: the same window drawn at several points
along the preset's own motion, earlier phases fainter. It is computed from the
preset's numbers — its bezier curve, its duration, its style — not recorded off
the screen, which keeps it deterministic and reproducible in a test.
